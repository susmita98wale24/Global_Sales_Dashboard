# Global_Sales_Dashboard
This is a Power BI dashboard titled "Global Sales Dashboard". It is a visual summary of sales performance data across different regions, segments, categories, and time periods. Below is a complete explanation of each element in the dashboard: “The dashboard is interactive and dynamic. It allows users to filter by month, region, and time hierarchy like year, quarter, and day. All visuals update based on the selected filters, providing real-time insight into global sales.”

“Here at the top, we have key performance indicators that summarize the selected data: Total Orders: 41 Total Profit: 6.47K Total Quantity Sold: 198 Total Sales: 43.55K Year-over-Year Growth: 0.39%. These KPIs change based on the filters selected, such as the month of May and all regions combined.”

“On the top-left, we have a bar chart showing YoY% growth by region. The Central region performed the best with a 1.2% increase compared to last year, while the East had no growth. This helps identify which regions are driving growth or underperforming.”

“This pie chart shows total sales distribution by product category. Technology leads with over 56% of total sales, followed by Furniture and Office Supplies. This helps the business focus more on high-performing product categories.”

“The bar chart below shows the average sales by segment. The Consumer segment has the highest average sales at 1359, followed by Home Office and Corporate. This allows targeted marketing and service strategies for different customer types.”

“In the middle, the line chart displays total quantity sold over time from 2011 to 2013. We can observe a consistent trend with a recent spike in May 2013. This is useful for analyzing sales trends and seasonality.”

“On the bottom right, the donut chart shows sales contribution by city. Los Angeles and Jacksonville are the top-performing cities, contributing over 50% of the total. This allows geographic-based decision-making and expansion planning.”

“The dashboard includes buttons to filter data by month, and region, and toggle between Month-to-Date (MTD), Quarter-to-Date (QTD), and Year-to-Date (YTD). There's also a comparison option for the same period last year, which is useful for performance evaluation.”

“This dashboard is fully interactive and supports real-time data exploration using slicers for month, region, and time periods like Month-to-Date (MTD), Quarter-to-Date (QTD), and Year-to-Date (YTD).”

“On the left side, we have a month filter that allows selecting any month – in this case, April is selected. At the top, region buttons allow us to toggle between Central, East, South, and West.” “We also have buttons for toggling between MTD, QTD, and YTD, and a button for comparing the same period in the previous year.” “This treemap shows total orders by U.S. state. The largest boxes represent the highest-order states, such as: California, Michigan, New Jersey, Colorado

On the left side, we have a detailed sales table broken down by year, quarter, month, and day. This table also includes total sales and what seems to be a pricing or profit-related column. At the bottom, we can see the grand totals, with total sales reaching ₹5,67,167.92 and total pricing/profit amounting to ₹75,667.24. Moving to the top right, we have a visual that showcases the Top 10 Customers by Sales. This bar chart helps us quickly identify our most valuable customers. As we can see, William Brown, Zuschuss Carroll, and Victoria Brennan are our top three contributors. Below that, we have the Top 10 Products by Quantity Sold. This visualization shows which products are most in demand, with Xerox 1960, Xerox 209, and Zebra GX420t leading the list. This helps in better inventory and procurement decisions. On the right panel, we’ve included interactive buttons: Sales Report to navigate to the overall report, MTD_QTD_YTD to switch between different time period summaries, Same Period Last Year to compare with historical performance, And a Totals button to summarize key insights.

This dashboard is interactive, allowing users to filter and drill down into data for detailed analysis. It’s a powerful tool for decision-makers to track performance and make data-driven business decisions.
